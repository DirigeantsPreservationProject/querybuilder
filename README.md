# QueryBuilder

QueryBuilder is a tool made to create and format SQL schemas based on their datatypes, though basic sanitization is
included in this library, you should use the driver's sanitizer when available.

This library provides an interface that allows Schema types to be translated into their best fitting database-specific
SQL datatypes and formatting.
